class MatcherMacrosSpec extends Specification with ResultMatchers with MatcherMacros { def is = s2"""

 It is possible to define a matcher with methods matching the public members of a given type

 We can specify:
   just the type to match                                               $e0
   a value for one of the members                                       $e1
   a matcher for one of the members                                     $e2
   a function returning a result for one of the members                 $e3
   several values at once                                               $e4

 The first member value to fail will return the failure message         $e5
 The member name must be mentioned in the failure message               $e6
 The expectable description must be included in the failure message     $e7
